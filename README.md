# Twitter _Clone
This project is a simple Twitter-Clone application designed to replicate the functionality of Twitter. It includes features such as
user login, registration, and authentication, allowing users to create accounts and securely access the platform. The overall goal is 
to create an interface that closely resembles the layout and design of Twitter, providing users with a familiar and seamless experience.
By mimicking the look and feel of Twitter, users will be able to navigate the application
with ease, interact with posts, follow other users, and engage in conversations just as they would on the original platform..
